            <p class="para">Everyday digital interfaces include a rich variety of images,<br> visualizations, and other
                pictures.
                However, more than anything<br> else, they are made of words. Oh so many words. As we equip<br> teams to
                design
                and code usable, consistent, beautiful interfaces<br> using systems, it's essential that words depend on
                a
                strong<br> foundation of typography.</p>
            <p class="para">I'll admit, I am not a typography expert. I lack a graphic design<br> degree. I'm
                never the
                person choosing a font, scaling type, or<br> finessing letter spacing. As a result, I've always
                been
                reluctant to<br> write about typography.</p>
            <p class="para">On the other hand, I am a pattern hunter. Over the years, I've<br> contributed to many
                design
                systems that set a foundation for<br> typography. Each traversed of steps and decisions to set a<br>
                foundation
                and apply it to an emerging library of interface <br>components. This article summarizes those patterns.
            </p>
            <p class="para">Typography starts by setting a foundation of font families and <br>weights along with
                fallbacks.
                It then explores how to build<br> hierarchy using size, color, additional details like line-height,<br>
                and
                layering responsiveness. Those models are then applied to <br>components in a system's library (like
                Article
                and Header) as<br> well as custom components made by other teams.</p>
